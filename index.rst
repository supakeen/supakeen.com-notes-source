My notes on things I encounter. I use these notes because writing things down
makes it easier for me to remember. Writing things down has the added advantage
that I can link people these notes to learn from my weird way of jotting blurbs
down.

If you're reading this notes do visit the links in them, they refer to where I
got my own ideas from.

These notes might be both opinionated but are always simplified, they leave out
things to fasten learning. If you want to know more about a subject don't take
these notes as *all there is* but as a starting point.

Some notes might be technically wrong, if you see a flaw in my understanding
please let me know! My contact information is on my website_.
