async/await
-----------
Python 3.5 added async/await syntax to Python. This is an implementation of
Asynchronous I/O. It provides a programming idiom where functions can wait
for something and other functions to be ran during this wait time. When the
function is ready again it can continue where it left off.

I have an entire notebook on Asynchronous I/O which goes into a lot more depth
about implementation and when to use but the short of it is that it maps
perfectly on performing I/O which is mostly networking where a lot of our time
is spent waiting for the other side to reply. The idiom applies to other tasks
as well but doesn't map very well onto CPU intensive tasks where there is
little waiting involved.
